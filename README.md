# Functionalities
+ Free mode: play any of the 7 notes (do, re, mi, fa, so, la, and si) freely
+ Autoplay mode: listen to any songs from the music library (Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Two Tigers, and Ode to Joy)
+ Learning mode: learn how to play any songs from the music library with real-time performance rating
+ Save user's highest score in learning mode (support up to 3 users)
+ Support octave adjustment in every mode, including high, normal, and low ocatave, hence able to output 7Ã—3 = 21 different music notes
+ Support speed adjustment in autoplay mode
+ Support VGA, LED, and seven-segment display output for intuitive and convenient interaction with the FPGA board
